# agents/context_manager.py
# This file defines the Context Manager Agent workflow.
# The Context Manager Agent tracks conversation context, summarizes important details,
# and can use tools such as search_web, read_file, and write_file.
# It uses ChatAnthropic (Claudeâ€‘2) and a ToolNode to perform these tasks.
