"""
This module defines various utility tools for the LangGraph multi-agent AI.
Each tool is decorated with @tool from langchain_core.tools for compatibility
with LangGraph. The tools include:

  - search_web: Simulates a web search.
  - python_repl: Simulates executing Python code.
  - read_file: Reads file contents.
  - write_file: Writes content to a file.
  - calendar_tool: Simulates calendar updates.
  - task_tracker_tool: Simulates task tracking updates.
  - job_search_tool: Simulates job search results.
  - get_current_weather: Simulates current weather information.
  - calc_tool: Evaluates a mathematical expression.
  - news_tool: Simulates retrieving news headlines.
