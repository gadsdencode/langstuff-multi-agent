# agents/project_manager.py
# This file defines the Project Manager Agent workflow.
# The Project Manager Agent oversees project timelines, tasks, and scheduling.
# It has access to tools like search_web, calendar_tool, and task_tracker_tool.
# It uses ChatAnthropic (Claudeâ€‘2) and a ToolNode to manage project-related activities.
